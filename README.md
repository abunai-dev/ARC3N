ARC続N is part of the ABUNAI approach to uncertainty-aware confidentiality analysis.
This repository provides tool support for the first two steps of the procedure shown below: The identification and classification of uncertainty sources.
For further information, please see the [dissertation](https://doi.org/10.5445/IR/1000178700) *Chapter 4.1* on the procedure and *Chapter 5* on the identification and classification of
uncertainty Regarding confidentiality.
